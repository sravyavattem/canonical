Test Case for SSH connectivity using Password and Key based auth:

Initial steps:

•	To verify SSH connection, set up a remote server. 
•	Have a machine with SSH client like OpenSSH or PuTTY installed. 
•	The server should allow inbound connections from the IP address of client and should have SSH enabled with key-based and password authentication allowed.

1)	For password authentication:

    a)	After ensuring that the above conditions are met, we can start the SSH client. 
    b)	Specify the destination you want to connect to (Server's IP or Hostname) 
    c)	Enter the username and password and open the connection. 

If successful, you will receive access to the server's CLI without any errors. 
If you are unable to access, or face any errors- for instance, authentication failures, that means the SSH connection has failed. Ensure that the credentials are correct.

2)	Key based authentication:

    a)	The process is similar. With an additional step. Generate an SSH key pair (public and private key) on Client.
    b)	Add the public key to the authorized keys file on Server.
    c)	Once that is complete, you can start the SSH client and provide IP along with the username. Select the private key generated earlier and try to open the connection. 

Same as before, if successful, you will receive access to the server's CLI without any errors. 
If any errors like authentication failure show up or you are unable to access the CLI, the SSH connection has failed. Verify that the right key-pair is being used and that the public key has been added to the list of authorized keys.

Tools: Any compatible SSH software like PuTTY or OpenSSH

Teardown: After testing is complete, we can remove any files or configuration created specifically during the process of testing if we do not need them.
